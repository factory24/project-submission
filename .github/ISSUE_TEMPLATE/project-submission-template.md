**Motivation and overview**

Why are you doing this? What impact will the project have if it is completely successful?

**Technical approach**

How will it work? Convince us that your project has a good chance of meeting the goals of the motivation. What are the risks, unknowns and external dependencies, and how will you cope with them?

**Team background and qualifications**

Summarize pertinent background of the team member(s). Optionally, attach CVs.

**Evaluation plan**

What would your project look like if successful, and how would we be able to tell? Include quantifiable metrics if possible.

**Security considerations**

What are the implications of this project to the privacy, integrity, availability? Does it create, or mitigate, potential attacks? Is user education needed to use it securely? This is especially relevant for technical projects.

**Schedule**

What is your timeline for the project? Please list several concrete milestones along this timeline.

**Budget and justification**

How much money do you need, and how will you spend it (e.g., compensation for your effort, specific equipment, specific external services)? Specify a total in USD, and its breakup into 1-6 budget items with their rationale. Multiple alternatives, with different scope and cost, can be provided.

We expect a typical project to require approximately 3 pages to adequately discuss the above.

**Email address(es) for direct contact**

GitHub issues are great for public discussion but the review committee occasionally prefers email addresses for direct communication.
